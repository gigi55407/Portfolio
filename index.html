      <p><strong>Hi! My name is Jennifer Wandersee, and I recently completed a coding bootcamp at the University of Minnesota and look forward to using my skills
        in a web developer position. Through the bootcamp I have gained knowledge and experience in full stack web development, including html, cascading style sheets, javascript, jQuery, 
        Node, GitHub and GitBash. I used these skills to complete individual projects and to collaborate with others in group projects. Please visit my portfolio page to see examples of my work.</strong></p>
        
      <p><strong>In addition to web development skills, I have 15 years' experience as a technical writer, including creating manuals, stand-alone pieces, online job aids and eLearning modules. 
      Although I am primarily focused on leveraging my coding skills, I would be glad to contribute my technical writing skills to projects if the need arises in my next position.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>When I'm not working on coding or writing projects, I enjoy spending time in nature, taking part in musical pursuits, gardening, and visiting with friends at my neighborhood cafe.</strong></p>
